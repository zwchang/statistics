Here we illuminate some important statistics concepts which are directly relevant in the context of data science and big data. The course material we current use is the first 3 chapters of the book "Practical Statistics for Data Scientists".

1. [Exploratory data analysis](exploratoryDataAnalysis_Chap1.ipynb)
2. [Data and sampling distributions](dataSamplingDistributions_Chap2.ipynb)
3. [Statistical experiment and significance testing](statExptSigTest_Chap3.ipynb)
